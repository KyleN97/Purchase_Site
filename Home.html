       Created by Massive Entertainment, The Division is a new game in the Tom Clancy franchise. Developed using the Snowdrop engine, it is an open world, multiplayer RPG game set in a world devastated by a deadly pathogen in which players will fight enemy factions, loot abandoned buildings and level up their player as they explore a ravaged New York City.

       You are part of The Division, an organization developed around Operation Dark Winter, a training program that took place in 2001 which simulated a bio-terrorist attack on the U.S. and the resulting aftermath and response. However, the devastation of the "Black Friday" event quickly makes Operation Dark Winter a startling reality. In response, the President signs Directive 51, launching The Division's Agents into effect.'

        Dark Souls III is an action role-playing game set in a third-person perspective, similar to previous games in the series. According to lead director and series creator Hidetaka Miyazaki, the game's gameplay design followed "closely from Dark Souls II".Players are equipped with a variety of weapons including shortbows, explosives like fire bombs, greatswords and dual-wielding swords to fight against enemies, and shields that can be used to deflect an enemies' attack and protect the player from suffering damage.
                            
        In addition, attacks can be evaded through dodge-rolling.Bonfires, which serve as checkpoints, return from previous installments.Ashes, according to Miyazaki, play an important role in the game. Magic is featured in the game and the magic meter returns from Demon's Souls.

      Overwatch features squad-based combat with two opposing teams of six players each. Players choose one of several hero characters, each with their own unique abilities and role classes. The four character roles include: offense characters with high speed and attack but low defense, defense characters meant to form choke points for enemies, support characters that provide buffs and debuffs for their allies and enemies respectively (such as healing or speed alterations), and tank characters that have a large amount of armor and hit points to withstand enemy attacks and draw fire away from teammates. Players can switch between characters in-game following deaths, which is encouraged by the game's overall design.
